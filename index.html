        <h2>By the Beach, I Find My Peace</h2>

        <p> By the beach, I find my peace,<br>
            Sitting in the golden sands, at ease.<br>
            Listening to the waves, their gentle song,<br>
            A lullaby for hearts, where we all belong.<br>
        </p>
           <p> 
            The wind whispers secrets in my ear,<br>
            Brushing my face, so cool and clear.<br>
            It carries away my worries and care,<br>
            Leaving me with solace, a soul laid bare.<br>
        </p> 
        <p>
            With each crashing wave, I'm set free,<br>
            All that I've known, it takes with glee.<br>
            In this moment, nature's sweet embrace,<br>
            I find serenity, in this tranquil place.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun kisses the horizon goodnight,<br>
            Painting the sky in hues of warm light.<br>
            As stars twinkle above, a celestial embrace,<br>
            I cherish this peace, by the beach's grace.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So here I'll stay, by the ocean's side,<br>
            Where the waves and the wind are my guide.<br>
            In this tranquil moment, I find my release,<br>
            By the beach, listening, finding inner peace.</p>
